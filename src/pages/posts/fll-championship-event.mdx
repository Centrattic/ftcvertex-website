We made some friends on other FTC friends! \[Penny, Vincent, Kai and members in Team Gluten Free\]

Some of our team members attended the FIRST Lego League state championship in NH, and presented our robot to the FLL students and got them excited about FTC!

A lot of the FLL members are very interested in FTC and our school!
