				<p class="py-4 px-4 text-sm md:text-xl">
					FTC team VERTEX is excited to announce that we will be
					hosting VTXCADs 2022: an annual CADathon for interested
					students of all experience levels. A CADathon, similar to a
					hackathon, is an educational, project-based CAD
					(Computer-Aided Design) competition. Utilizing a CAD
					software of their choice, teams of students will design a
					robot that best suits the yearly game challenge. Their
					submissions will be presented to a panel of judges that will
					assess their designs based on a rubric that includes
					project, presentation, and teamwork.
				</p>
				<p class="py-4 px-4">
					All middle and high schoolers internationally are welcome to
					participate. VTXCADs 2022 consists of two categories: a
					traditional FTC-style design competition, and a second,
					novice-friendly category complete with a free workshop
					series led by experienced professionals/students.
