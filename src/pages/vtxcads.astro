                <p class="py-4 px-4">
                    FTC team VERTEX is excited to announce that we will be hosting VTXCADs 2022: an annual CADathon for interested students of all experience levels. A CADathon, similar to a hackathon, is an educational, project-based CAD (Computer-Aided Design) competition. Utilizing a CAD software of their choice, teams of students will design a robot that best suits the yearly game challenge. Their submissions will be presented to a panel of judges that will assess their designs based on a rubric that includes project, presentation, and teamwork.

                <p class="py-4 px-4">
                    All middle and high schoolers internationally are welcome to participate. VTXCADs 2022 consists of two categories: a traditional FTC-style design competition, and a second, novice-friendly category complete with a free workshop series led by experienced professionals/students.
